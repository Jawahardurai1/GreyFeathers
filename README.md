Responsive E-commerce template built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Features a modern UI including a hero section, categories, product grid, product detail pages, and a responsive navbar & footer.

Notes:

Static product data included; ready to integrate with an API.

Fully mobile-first and responsive design.
AI tools (ChatGPT) were used responsibly to assist with coding and meet an immediate deadline, with all code reviewed and understood by the developer.
Due to a shortage of time, the application is not hosted live. Instead, I have attached screenshots of the application to demonstrate the UI and functionality. Apologies for the inconvenience, and thank you for understanding.
